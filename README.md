# BibXpert

BibXpert is an open-source bibliography management tool for LaTeX BibTex files. BibXpert operates simultaneously over multiple BibTex files through a single command line. The tool provides mechanisms to automatically concatenate bib entries from different files, resolve duplicated entries, and limit the number of authors to be displayed. In addition, it can verify data integrity of bib entries with commonly research scholar web services such as DOI, IEEE XPlore, Science Direct, and arXiv.
