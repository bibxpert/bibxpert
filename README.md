# BibXpert

BibXpert is an open-source bibliography management tool for LaTeX 
BibTex files. BibXpert operates simultaneously over multiple 
BibTex files through a single command line. The tool provides 
mechanisms to automatically concatenate bib entries from different 
files, resolve duplicated entries, limit the number of authors 
to be displayed, and compress bibliography entries to save space
in the text. 
Additionally, it can verify data integrity of bib entries with
commonly research scholar web services such as DOI, IEEE XPlore, 
Science Direct, PubMed Central, and arXiv.
